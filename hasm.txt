		HASM v1.0

   Usage:
   ------
	hasm [options] source

	This assembler accepts one source file that will be used
	to build an NES ROM file to be used by an emulator.

	Option	Description
	------	-----------
	-raw	The 'raw' flag causes the assembler to skip the
		generation of the iNES header. If the 'raw' flag
		is not used, the iNES header will be generated.

   Directives:
   -----------
	include		Includes another source file to be used
			  by the assembler.
			  ex: .include "source_2.asm"
	includebin	Includes a binary file to be used by the
			  assembler.
			  ex: .includebin "graphics.bin"
	address		Sets the location of the memory address
			  counter to the specified address.
			  ex: .address $0200
	byte		Allows the inclusion of arbitrary bytes
			  of data to be defined in the binary.
			  ex: .byte $45, $A0
	word		Allows the inclusion of arbitrary words
			  of data to be defined in the binary.
			  ex: .word $4500, $A000
	inesprg		Sets the PRG byte of the iNES header to
			  the specified value.
			  .inesprg #$02
	ineschr		Sets the CHR byte of the iNES header to
			  the specified value.
			  .ineschr #$02
	inesmir		Sets the MIR byte of the iNES header to
			  the specified value.
			  .inesmir #$02
	inesplc		Sets the PlayChoice byte of the iNES
			  header to the specified value.
			  .inesplc #$02
	inesreg		Sets the Region byte of the iNES header
			  to the specified value.
			  .inesreg #$02
   Operands:
   ---------
	By default, HASM strictly enforces the way operands may
	be used. Operand modes that do not explicitly conform to
	the specification are considered invalid and will be
	rejected.

	Operand		Example
	-------		-------
	Immediate	#$4F
	Zero-Page	$44
	Zero-Page,x	$44,x
	Zero-Page,y	$44,y
	Absolute	$4400
	Absolute,x	$4400,x
	Absolute,y	$4400,y
	Indirect	($4400)
	Indirect,x	($44,x)
	Indirect,y	($44,y)
	Accumulator	a
	Implied
	Relative	LABEL

   Labels:
   -------
	HASM allows the use of labels in place of having to write
	a commonly used address multiple times. A label is not case
	sensitive and may or may not end with a semi-colon ':'

	Labels must start with a letter and all other characters may
	be a letter, digit, or underscore '_'

	Labels used as a relative operand MAY NOT end in a semi-colon.
